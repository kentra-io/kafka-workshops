## About the workshops

Workshops are designed for live online format with heavy emphasis on practical excercises. They can be done onsite as well - we're located in Warsaw, Poland but happy to travel if that's the preferred format.

Workshops can be tuned to the needs of the customer to match your tech stack - Java, Avro and Spring Boot are used because they are the most popular technologies, but the content can be adapted if that's requested.
